# Casey Due's Jambalaya #

## Ingredients

1. 1 tablespoon canola oil
2. 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2-inche cubes
3. 1 pound smoked sausage, cut into 1-inch pieces
4. 1 large white onion, chopped (about 2 cups)
5. 1 large green bell pepper, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)
6. 1 cup chopped celery (about 1 stalk)
7. 3 garlic cloves, minced
8. 2 bay leaves
9. 1 tablespoon Creole seasoning
10. 1 teaspoon dried thyme
11. 1 teaspoon dried oregano
12. 2 cups uncooked converted rice
13. 3 cups chicken broth
14. 2 (14.5 oz) cans diced fire-roasted tomatoes
15. Sliced scallions (optional)

## Steps
1. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high. Add chicken and sausage, and cook, stirring constantly, until browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to paper towels; blot with paper towels.
2. Add onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic, bay leaves, Creole seasoning, thyme, and oregano to hot drippings; cook over medium-high until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in rice, and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, tomatoes, chicken, and sausage. Bring to a boil over high. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Garnish with sliced scallions, if desired.

## Alternatives and Substitutes
1. The main multiform in my version of this recipe: I use Turkey kielbasa which is lighter than regular sausage.
2. In US grocery stores you can actually buy this super easy mix called Zatarain's, to which all you have to do really is add the chicken and sausage
